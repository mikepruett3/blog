I cant wait! I loved God of War I & II on the PS2, and was really impressed with God of War: Chains of Olympus on PSP.

I had passed on buying a PS3 at launch in 2006, only to buy a much cheaper Xbox 360. I still like my 360, and their are more games out for the platform... but I knew that one day I would have to get the PS3 as well.

I put it off long enough, waiting only for a new Sly Cooper game or a new God of War game. Looks like I might get the latter, hopefully sooner!

If you haven't checked out the site, [go there now!](http://www.us.playstation.com/GodofWarIII/) It just launched a few days ago. Watch the Insane trailer, and you too will know why I cannot wait to play as Kratos again!

I think I am going to bust out the original and the second installment until the new installment is out...

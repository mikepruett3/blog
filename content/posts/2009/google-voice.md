Yes! I finally got my invite to Google Voice (thank you _**EvilSkill9**_)!!

So far, so good. Everything looks pretty easy to setup. Looks like Google built in support for SMS messaging, and Voicemail. Aparently you can replace your standard Mobile Phone Voicemail for GV. Too Cool!

I am not sure if I am going to put the Voice App on the blog yet.

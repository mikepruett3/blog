This has been a fun event so far. We have been fed on a regular basis, and Pulvermedia has sprung for the Top-Shelf Liquor. I did get to spend a lot of time with Marc Spencer w/ Digium. Great guy, and soooo damn young! I have a few more hours here before catching a plane, so lets see what-else this conference has in store.

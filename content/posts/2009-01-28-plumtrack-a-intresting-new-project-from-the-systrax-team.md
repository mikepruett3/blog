[Jo-G](http://www.plixer.com/blog/author/Jo-G) of [Systrax Blog](http://www.plixer.com/blog) posted an article today on one of their many upcomming projects that they have been working on. plumTrack seems to provide some intresting reporting options for the Open Source PBX software [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org). The product also provides integration to Plixer's own [Scrutinizer](http://www.plixer.com/products/scrutinizer.php) gadgets, and [Maximizer Enterprise](http://maximizer.com/) CRM products.

Excerpt from the post...

```quote
We have developed a Call Tracking system to monitor and report statistics of our Sales
and Technical Support phone activity on our[Asterisk PBX](http://www.asterisk.org/) system.

The result is our in-house tool plumTrack, which provides call statistics including total
number of calls per person, total time on the phone (both incoming and outgoing), and
also broken out by internal (company extension) calls and external calls. This is tailored
very specifically to our needs, as this tool is used to base our monthly bonuses on.
Management uses this tool to track how many calls to customers and how long, in minutes,
we were on the phone.
```

As a fan of Plixer's products, and a long-time supporter of Digum's Asterisk... I can only expect great things from this project. (Considering the utter lack of robust reporting from Asterisk currently.)

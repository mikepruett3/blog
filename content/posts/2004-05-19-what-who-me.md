Long day... and it just keeps _dragging_.

Hopefully this day will **END SOON**! :(

Todays thoughts...

* Google Mail sounds cool.
* Gmail sounds even _cooler_,Â but I need an invite. (_Please!_)
* Cisco gear is so mother-effing **Expensive**!
* Oh, did I mention that a Gmail invite would be **Awesome**! :grinning:

_Don't pay any attention to me, I am just really tired!_

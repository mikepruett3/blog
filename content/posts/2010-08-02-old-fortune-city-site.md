[![fortunecity](/uploads/ajprod01.jpg)](/fortunecity/default.htm) 

While reviewing some of my old Hard-drives, I discovered that I had and copy of a site that I had build on Fortune City hosting. (Circa 1998) This would not have been my original site that I setup, but it is still old and crappy. My little home on the internet at that time was

http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/swampthing/104/
(Site predates the Internet Wayback Machine, so obviously dead link!)

This looks like an EARLY attempt to create a blog, before I even knew what a blog was. I did get some content on there, and its great fun to look at (or laugh at)!

I took a few days and cleaned up the code a bit before moving it on to this site for posterity sake. (Taught myself a little CSS at the same time.)

So you can see what I am talking about, please go [here](/fortunecity/default.htm) and have a laugh!

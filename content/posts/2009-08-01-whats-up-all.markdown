I am still here. Thankfully my hosting company got their act's together, and now we have plenty of bandwith to support this blog. Recently post have been just my Delicious bookmarks, which are posted to the blog on a nightly basis. (I will do a follow-up post on how to do that.)

Just an update of what I am working on...

* Upgrading our BlueCoat SG Proxy from an SG400 to a SG510.
* Migrating to an eBGP peering environment between our two Upstream Providers. (Load-Ballancing 110Mbps)
* Learning PowerShell!
* Virtualization, Virtualization, Virtualization...
* Developing some cmdlets to control an Asterisk Host remotely, thru the API Manager interface.
* Implementing Cisco SSL VPN to replace our exisiting IPsec VPN.
* Implementing Altiris Client Management Suite, including the Helpdesk Solution.

~~Whew!

Update -- I stopped all of the auto-bookmarks. It made the front page look like utter shite!

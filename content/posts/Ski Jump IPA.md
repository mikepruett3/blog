Hoppy IPA's are just damn refreshing! I tend to like Hop-Forward IPA's... as well as Hazy's. A good strong flavor, without a huge bitter bite is more my style.

As a Newcomer to the UP area, I have been exploring the local breweries in the area for hidden jems! So far, I have been impressed with the selections including the [51st State Brewing Company](https://www.51ststatebrewingco.com/)!

The pub food is excellent. I would suggest their Pizza's... as they are cooked in a wood fired oven. Crispy crust is a must!

The jewel of the Brewery has to be the [Ski Jump IPA](https://untappd.com/b/51st-state-brewing-company-ski-jump-ipa/2492235)! It's really refreshing. At 7.6% is Sessionable, but you might want to call an Uber.

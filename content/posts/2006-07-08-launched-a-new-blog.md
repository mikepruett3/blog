With my good friend, we have decided to lauch a new team blog that focuses on technology knowledge sharing. Both of us are IT Professionals, and have many years experience. Instead of being greedy and not sharing, we decided to listen to Tux & share the wealth of knowledge to the public.

So check it out... its called ["Communication Meltdown"](http://communication-meltdown.blogspot.com) and its LIVE!!

I will still be posting on this blog, but most of the technical stuff will be posted on the new blog.

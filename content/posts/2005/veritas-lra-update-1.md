Still not working as of yet. I have been on the Veritas support forums for 2 days now. I posted a question to there technical staff, and I got one responce:

> Update the client with a patch.

I've update the RHEL server with the patch, and still no success.

The problem is, I can backup anything from the RHEL3 server... but I cannot restore it back to the server. (Extremely frustrating!)

I will continue to work on this... there **MUST** be a way!!

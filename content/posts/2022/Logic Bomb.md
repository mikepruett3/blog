Back to relaxing in Upper Peninsula, and enjoying mild 80â„‰ weather for my 4th of July weekend!

Picked up some [Surly Brewing Company's](https://surlybrewing.com/) [Logic Bomb](https://surlybrewing.com/beer/logic-bomb/) Juicy Pale Ale from the local [Super One Foods](https://www.superonefoods.com/)... my favorite local grocery store. Super One's remind me of Piggy Wigley's, which also only exist in the North-Mid-West for some reason!

Super tasty, and good for cooling you off while grilling. Steaks were delicious, and did not last long.

## My Check-in's

Wifey said that I was stressed recently, and that we should go have a dinner date. God I love her, and would not know what to do without her!

She suggested that I pick the Place & Food (Generally this is a long discussion/argument for what to eat!), and I suggested that I wanted a really good hamburger! She had never been to [Rodeo Goat](https://www.rodeogoat.com/fort-worth/), and I had a hankering for Chorizo and Beef! The Chaca Oaxaca to the rescue!

Generally I usually go to Rodeo Goat for lunch, as its not far from where I work in Downtown. Never once looked at the Beer menu, as I don't think I would live it down with the rest of my team. I was pleasantly surprised by their selection! Lots of good brews and stuff I have never had before!

Normally I look for local Craft Brews first, as I like exploring for _hidden gems_, but this time I spotted Tripel's on the menu! See my other beer review posts, but one of my all time favorite Belgian Tripel is the [St. Bernardus Abt 12](https://www.sintbernardus.be/en/brewery/our-beers/stbernardus-abt-12-en) (Actually, its a Quad!). Belgian's are always refreshing, and can be dangerous for me... as I have been know to throw a few back in a single night.

Low and behold Rodeo Goat had a 9.5% ABV Tripel from [Victory Brewing Company](https://victorybeer.com/), called [Golden Monkey](https://victorybeer.com/beers/golden-monkey/). Surprising refreshing, and no bitter aftertaste, like other Tripel's I have tried before. Paired well with the burger, even the heat from the Jalape√±o's.

So, I like beer... good beer. My tastes have changed over the years, and I am more of a social drinker now, but I still enjoy my liquid bread! 

I tend to gravitate towards Hazy & Double IPA's, but one of my all-time favorites types of beers is Belgian Tripel's. My absolute special being the St. Bernardus Abt 12, which is actually a Belgian Quad!

I am not alone in that sentiment, as it is widely regarded as one of the best beers in the world. (from the [website](https://www.sintbernardus.be/en/brewery/our-beers/stbernardus-abt-12-en) )

Recently I tried a new Tripel from [Kickstand Brewing Company](https://www.kickstandbrewingco.com/), called [Long Strange Trip](https://untappd.com/b/kickstand-brewing-co-long-strange-trip/1391459). Kickstand is a Michigan Brewery, which is great as I have been on a hunt to discover beers from the area. I believe the brewery is in the UP (Upper Peninsula) well... bonus!

Its sweet and refreshing, with a smooth flavor. I would not consider this Sessionable though, what Tripel is! The brew clocks in at 9.9% ABV, so for me that's a one for the night brew.

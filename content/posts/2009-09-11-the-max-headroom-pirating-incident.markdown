Really interesting Documentary on the incident. Kind of makes you think about that struggle between Broadcasting Companies, and the Jackers who wanted to take over their airwaves.

I would assume that this trick is still possible in 3rd-World countries where the Media does not have the $$$ like US Broadcasters.

Plus... Max Headroom was an awesome show! I miss a lot of the older/weirder shows from my youth.

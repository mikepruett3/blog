## So here we are...

After trying to keep this thing alive for way to long, I have decided to give it another shot.

So much of this site is my own personal musings and ramblings, that I'm not sure if I even remember where I was headed in the first place. I do have some interesting old posts, specifically about storage, tapes, and the cloud. Might be worth a read for someone.

## The Future

Well, my goal is to get a post out once a week. Might be harder than expected, but its a goal none the less.

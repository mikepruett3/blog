_Man, I am so bummed out!_

Gerald (G-Dog, or EvilSkill9), my right hand-man for like 8 years has left California.

He is heading east, out to Ohio to start a new life with his girl.

Good for him.... but I allready miss the **bastard**!

I can't even imagine what our phone bills are going to be like. :smile:

The reality has just kicked in, but I am a little far from sobbing... :cry:

Damn,I hope he does well at his new job.

**JUST KILL ME! I NEED TO GO BACK TO BED!**

**_Oh yeah, and work sux!_** :rage:

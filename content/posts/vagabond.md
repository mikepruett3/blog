Well, thanks to Rocket Mortgage and the fine folks of Breitung Township... I have purchased a nice small vacation home in Kingsford, MI.!!!

We are now live in the Upper Peninsula, or UP for short!

My wife is from the UP (Park Falls, WI specifically), and has done a lot of research on the Kingsford area. One of the things she discovered is that Henry Ford and his friends used to have a house they used in the summer for shenanigans in the early 1900's. This group included Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs. They called themselves the Four Vagabonds. Aparently the group spent a lot of summers in the Kingsford area.

My wife was so inspired by this story, she named the house "The Vagabond".

Our plans for the house is to use it for our Summer Vacations (Like the Four Vagabonds), as Texas is way to damn hot! Also, we plan to rent the property via AirBNB for the times we are not there. This gives my wife the job of managing the house remotley... which she is happy to do.

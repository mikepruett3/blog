Havent updated this in a while... but I promise to add more content!

Just as an FYI of what I have been working on in the past 6 - 9 months:

- Implementing a 300+ user Asterisk Implementation
- Re-vising the companies SOX controls.
- Creating new IT Procedures, revising old ones.
- Finishing up a massive NetBackup deployment.
- Completing an Internal Process Walkthrough. (One every year!)
- Planning our VMWare V3i implementation.
- Trying to stay afloat!

Thats all for now, stay tuned!

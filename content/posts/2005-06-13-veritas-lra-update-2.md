Ok... Veritas is ignoring me!!!

I am waiting paitently for some resolution on this, but to no avail!

In the meantime, I have been working on Deploying the "Cisco VPN Client" via Group Policy.

Group Policy is awesome... I have a renewed faith in Microsofts Enginering staff. Still not as good or easy as Norton's Novell Installer software... (Name that escapes me! Anyone who knows, chime in!) but it works!

I will keep everyone posted!

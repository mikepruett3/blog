So this site has long be running on an older branch of a Jekyll theme, that was heavly modified. I have always had problems updating the site, not to mention getting Jekyll to run properly on Windows. Also, I am not a real fan of Ruby.

Last year during our horrible dark times, I set out to learn a new programming language. I had been messing with Golang for a little while, and I finally sat down with some awesome online classes from PluralSight, and really got to task. Go is a great language, and I love how you can easily re-compile programms for any Operating System. Super easy and convient.

Also at this time, I learned about the HUGO project, and thought this would be an easy way to take some of my pracical learning from PluralSight and apply it to this aging website.

Fast-foward almost 7 months, and I am happy to say that this site is 100% generated using HUGO. I am much happier with the links, and shortcodes are awesome. The theme that I settled on was [Razon Yang](https://github.com/razonyang)'s [hugo-theme-bootstrap](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap) theme. It did take a while to unpack all of the themes settings and parameters... and configure them to my liking. I may change in the future, or may even make my own!

So the TL:DR for this post is that the website is back, and now running on HUGO. Hopefully I can make this a very easy update and release process... which would cause me to acutally use the site more!

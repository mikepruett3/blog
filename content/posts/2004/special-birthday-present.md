**_I finally did it!!_**

As a Birthday Present for my 29th Birthday (Today.), my wife bought me a motorcycle.

(Can you believe it?? What a Gal!)

I have been_ pining_ for an older bike, so I can fix it up and not have to worry about some serious monetary commitments.

Well for $1400 and the cost of a 2XL helmet... (I have a **BIG F%^& HEAD**!!), I am the proud owner of a 1965 BSA A65 Rocket.

Its definitely a fixer upper... but what a sweet looking ride. (Wife is addicted to e-bay, going rate for one of these bad-boys is $3K.) This sweet machine is a steal!

Here's the auction info:

**1965 BSA A65 Rocket twin**

* Miles:  8675309
* Engine Type:  Medium (500-699 cc)
* Exterior:  Blue - Metallic
* VIN Number:  A65C1661

Ok.. now that I got the technical stuff out of the way, here is the un-cool stuff.

**THIS BIKE WAS MADE BY SOMEONE ON CRACK!!!**

The good stuff... Everything is fricking backwards!

Everytime I went to pull in the clutch, I ended up yanking on the brakes. The damn shifter is on the RIGHT SIDE!!! Stalled the bike 6 times before I was able to ride away from the sellers house. I have never had to work with a kick-start, so that was an experience in itself. The kick-start pin was broken, but the seller had the quick though to use a large bolt to hold the kick in place. (Oh yes... It gets funnier!!) Everytime I tried to kick the bike over, the damn kick and the pin fell off!! I was successful on the 7th time to get down the street, only to stall out at the stop sign.

It gets worse. The seller heard me cursing at the bike all the way back at his house, and decided to come to my aid. (All this time my wife was laughing at me and following me in the car.) Stellar guy, he felt pity for me and decided he would through in a hammer and a few bolts so that I could make it home. How embarrassing. Needless to say I figured it out after a few more times, and drove the bike back to my Apartment (A whole 6 miles. And no freeway action.) The bike is in decent condition, and leaks just a little. I need to get a aftermarket seat for this bike, or re-upholster this one 'cause my ass is hurting after only six miles. Oh well, its all fun and games till someone gets hurt.

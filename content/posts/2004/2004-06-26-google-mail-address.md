[......ooo000OOO FINALLY!! OOO000ooo......](http://gmail.google.com)

I now am the proud owner of a Gmail Address!!!

Damm all the warnings, and the conspiracy theories... I absolutely love Google!

I use there blogger service... and now the e-mail. **1 GB** of storage... what a dream!

I am the Network Administrator at my company, and I have a 175MB mailbox.

**THATS IT!!!**

_I am at peace now... and can return to whatever the hell I was doing before this._

**_Speakeasy SUX right now_**.

I'm not very thrilled! :(

I am having recurring problems where I keep loosing sync on new 6.0/768 install at my house.

Covad is comming to do a line test. Probably going to tell me that I am _14,999.8_ miles from the C.O., and to suck it up and like it.

If that happens, must convince my boss to let me expense aÂ **wireless T-1**.

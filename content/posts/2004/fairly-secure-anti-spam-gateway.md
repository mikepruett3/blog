Discovered a great new article on how to build your own "**_Fairly-Secure Anti-SPAM Gateway_**" using a lot of **Open-Source Software**.

These applications are pretty standard for any Linux _Sysadmin_, and should come as no shock...

* OpenBSD (or any *nix distro)
* Postfix
* Greylisting
* Amavisd-new
* SpamAssassin
* Razor
* DCC

The site is maintained by **Scott Vintinner**, and I can say that he did any excellent job. :)

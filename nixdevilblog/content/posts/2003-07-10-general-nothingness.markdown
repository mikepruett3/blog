Really tired right about now...

I am snagging a few albums and trying to finish **The Hulk**, all while still at the office! :grinning:

**Terminator 3** was pretty decent! I was not expecting the ending.

A round of kudos to the writers for an excellent script. Too bad they charge ten effing dollars ($10) to go see a movie.

Oh well, must get a hole saw kit to drill a BIG HOLE in my tower. Apparently I need more CFM or my processor will refuse to work. :cry:

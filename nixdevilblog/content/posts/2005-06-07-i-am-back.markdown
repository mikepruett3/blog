Its been awhile... and all I can say is **Im Back!**

I have been extremely busy for the past year, what with the massive undertaking of my Companies Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and managing the entire department while our new Director got up to speed. Not an easy task!

But now I'm back... and I plan to put this blog to good use!

So... to start of on the right foot, I am going to be documenting one of my many projects:

* Re-building my Gentoo Linux / SNORT IDS system

Its getting a little long in the tooth, and since I have been maintaing this box for the past year I have a better idea as how to do it right! (Long sentences... whatever.)

So out with the old... (Stupid Topics, Profanity... etc.) and in with the new!

Hopefully my ramblings can be of some use to the rest of the WWW.

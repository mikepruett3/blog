Not sure if this works, but I am destined to try!

Seems like newer games are requiring the 5.50 firmware, but I am still running CFW 5.00 M33! Where the hell is Dark-Alex gone to?

Oh well... for your viewing pleasure!

The instructions in the comments are pretty decent. If you need your PSP to be running Custom Firmware... let me know.

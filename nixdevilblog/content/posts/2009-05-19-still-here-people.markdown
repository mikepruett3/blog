Yep, I am still here on this site. I was having a few problems with my webhost earlier this month, but those should all be resolved by now. (I hope!)

Whats new in my life you ask... well lets see:

1. Completed a Data Center re-cabling job in less than 72 hours! That was no easy feat, involving most of my staff to give up a weekend to get it done. Looks great though, I will have to put up some photos of the finished product. (Once I get my Flickr account working again, that is.)

2. Implemented a new Three-Phase UPS. Now we have 40kVA of power to our new Data Center. This Liebert NX unit is scalable up to 80kVA with just a license key! Neat stuff.

3. Just finished installing our bran-spanking new NetApp 3140 Filers. Those things are sweet! Should have bought these a long time ago. (I will put up some more reasons why I like the new SAN in a future post.)
  
4. Knee-Deep in a VMware Implementation. This has been the bane of my existence for over a year. Not that implementing VMware is difficult or anything, but the previous infrastructure items needed to be in place before I could begin working on this.
  
5. Spent a few weeks messing around with VMware vSphere demos. Had to wait until the launch today before I could mention anything (even on Twitter)! Lots of good stuff included in the new ESX 4.0, and I am liking that they fixed a huge problem in vCenter.

As if thats not enough, my Sister had a sever stroke on May 12th. She is doing better, but has lost a lot of movement on her right-side. I might be taking some time off, and travelling back to TX to see herâ€¦ but for now I am just working like crazy!

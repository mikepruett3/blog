Found a very intresting piece of software called "Auditor". (Actually its a compilation of software, on a bootable CD) Its bascially a rip of Kanotix, (Knoppix Clone) with a LOT of applications. Most notable is a copy of Kismet & Airdump. With these tools, you can WarDive an almost brute-force your way into a wi-fi network. Pretty cool. Â =D

I will be trying this later on!!!

Here is a link to the "Auditor" webpage...

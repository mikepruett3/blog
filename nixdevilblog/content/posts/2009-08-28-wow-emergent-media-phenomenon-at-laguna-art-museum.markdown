There is an interesting even being held at the Laguna Arts Museum in Laguna Beach. From June 14th to Oct 4th 2009, the museum is hosting a Art Exhibit on the [Emergent Media Phenomenon of World of Warcraft](http://lagunaartmuseum.org/wow-emergent-media-phenomenon/). Normally I would say that this type of even it usually only appreciated by the fans of World of Warcraft (like me), but I think that anyone with a eye for decent art would appreciate it. I am not the Museum type, but this was right up my alley!

There were a number of illustrations, and paintings in the World of Warcraft theme. One exhibit was dedicated to the name plaque that is usually displayed above your characters head. Apparently a local artist thought it would be amusing if your name was to be displayed above your head, and created floating signs to do that. I would have liked to see floating QuestGiver signs... the floating yellow question marks above the NPC's heads. That would have been awesome, but that's just me.

All in all, my son & I had a great time at the event. I would recommend this event to anyone. You had better hurry thought, its almost over.

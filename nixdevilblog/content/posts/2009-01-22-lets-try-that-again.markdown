I am happy to announce the re-opening of this blog! Â **~w00t!** :)

<!-- more -->

A special Thank You to my new provider [Hosting Puppy](http://hostingpuppy.com/) for the site & the fantastic support.

After 3 unsuccessful hosting providers and 2 site-wide data corruption issues, one would think that I would learn from my mistakes.

Oh well, **4th** times the charm!

The only good news is that I am now extremely perficent at re-building my Wordpress site.
